<span>STERNE AT SUTTON ON THE FOREST.</span>

<p>The following extracts from the Register Book of the parish of Sutton on
the Forest, Yorkshire, which are in the handwriting of Lawrence Sterne,

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn1"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#ing1" class="label">[1]</a> There are two words in Sterne's
 own memoranda which may
puzzle other readers besides me; <i>Sushing</i> and <i>Stukbing</i>. I have
thought they might mean <i>sashing</i>, <i>i.e.</i> for windows, and <i>stuccoing</i>
the walls. Perhaps some contributor to "N. &amp; Q." will kindly interpret
them.</p>

<p>These two accounts of hailstorms are supposed to be only quizzes upon
prodigious entries of the same sort made by Vicar Walker in 1698. And
that this latter is so is evident, from the concluding words being the
same as in Walker's memorandum.</p>

<p>Sterne is characteristically exhibited in the subjoined account by the
successor of the "reverend joker":</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "In the year 1764, during the Incumbency of Mr. Lawrence Sterne,
   the Vicarage House was burnt down. Tho' frequently admonished and
   required to rebuild the Vicarage House, he found means to evade
   the performance of it. He continued Vicar till he died, in March,
   1768. Andrew Cheap was appointed his successor, and was advised
   to accept a composition for Dilapidations from the Widow. A Suit
   was instituted for Dilapidations, but after a time (the Widow
   being in indigent circumstances) sixty pounds were accepted.</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "In April, 1770, the New House was begun, and finished in May,
   1771.</p>

<p>In Mr. Knight's edition, from which the foregoing passage is printed and
pointed, the following note is appended to it:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"We encounter at the onset one of the obscure passages for which
   this play is remarkable. The text is usually pointed thus:&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">
                      <p class="i5">"'Then no more remains</p>
     <p> But that to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,</p>
     <p> And let them work.'</p>

</div>

<p class="blockquot">   It is certainly difficult to extract a clear meaning from this;
   and so Theobald and Hanmer assume that a line has dropped out,
   which they kindly restore to us, each in his own way."</p>


<p>After relating Steevens' attempt at elucidation, Mr. Knight proceeds to
explain the passage by a running interpretation parenthetically applied
to each expression; but I doubt very much whether any person would feel
much enlightened by it; or whether, amongst so many explanations, any
one of them could be pointed out less obscure than the rest.</p>

<p>Let us try, then, what a total change of interpretation will do.</p>

<p>In the sixth line of the Duke's speech, as quoted at the commencement,
we find the demonstrative pronoun <i>that</i>, which must have <i>some</i> object.
Mr. Knight supposes that object to be "your science." I, on the
contrary, am of opinion that it refers to <i>the commission</i> which the
Duke holds in his hand, and which he is in the act of presenting to
Escalus:</p>

<div class="poem">

                    <p class="i5">  "Then no more remains,</p>
      <p>But&mdash;that, to your sufficiency, as your worth is able,</p>
      <p>And let them work."</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">By transposition, this sentence becomes "Then, as your worth is able, no
more remains, to your sufficiency, but <i>that</i>."</p>

<p>But <i>what</i>?</p>

<p>Your <span class="smaller">COMMISSION</span>!</p>

<p>Have we not here the <i>mot</i> to the enigma, the clue to the mystery? When
the Duke takes up the commission, he addresses Escalus to the following
effect:</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"It would be affectation in me to lecture you upon the art of
   government, since I must needs know that your own science
   exceeds, in that, the limits of all I could teach you. Therefore,
   since your worth is able, no more remains to your sufficiency,
   but&mdash;<i>that</i>, and let them work."</p>


<p>The <i>sufficiency</i> here spoken of is twofold, ability to direct, and
<i>authority to enforce</i>. The first was personal to Escalus, consisting of
his own skill and knowledge; the second was conferred upon him <i>by
commission</i>: when both were united, he was to "let them work!"</p>

<p>Reading the passage in this way, there is no necessity for the
alteration of a single letter; and yet I will put it to any person of
sense and candour, whether the passage be not thereby relieved from all
real obscurity?</p>

<p>It must be borne in mind, that the presentation of the commission is the
<i>main object</i> of the Duke's address: the presentation therefore is not a
<i>single act</i>, but rather a protracted action during the whole speech,
finally consummated with the concluding words&mdash;"there is our
commission."</p>

<p>This is so plain, that it scarcely needs confirmation; but, if it did
so, it would receive it, by analogy, in the similarly protracted
presentation to Angelo when it becomes his turn to receive <i>his</i>
commission. In that case the act of presentation commences with the word
"hold:"</p>

<div class="poem">

    <p>  "Hold&mdash;therefore, Angelo!"<a id="Page_411"></a> <span class="pagenum">[411]</span></p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And finishes six lines lower down with:</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p>   "Take thy commission."</p>

</div>

<p>And it is not a little singular, that this word "hold," having been at
first similarly misinterpreted, proved as great a stumbling block to
Tyrwhitt and others, who seemed to grope about in sheer perverseness,
catching at any meaning for it rather than the right, and certainly the
obvious one.</p>

<h3>
<span>PRESENTIMENT.</span>
</h3>

<p>Seeing, in some of the former Numbers of the "N. &amp; Q.", a collection of
instances of sudden <i>high spirits</i> immediately preceding some great
calamity, it occurred to me that it would be not uninteresting to throw
together a few instances of sudden <i>low spirits</i>, or <i>illness</i>, attended
with a similar result. Here our only embarrassment is that of riches.</p>

<p>The first example I have selected is taken from the <i>Relation de la Mort
de MM. le Duc et le Cardinal de Guise</i>, by the Sieur Miron, physician to
King Henry III. He first narrates the preparations for the Duke's
assassination, and then proceeds as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p>   Et peu apr√®s que le Duc de Guise fut assis au conseil, 'J'ai
   froid, dit-il, le c&oelig;ur me fait mal: que l'on fasse de feu,' et
   s'adressant au Sieur de Morfontaine, tresorier de l'√©pargne,
   'Monsieur de Morfontaine, je vous prie de dire √† M. de S<span class="topnum">t</span> Prix,
   premier valet de chambre de roy, que je le prie de me donner des
   raisins de Darnas ou de la conserve de roses.' ... Le Duc de
   Guise met des prunes dans son drageoir, jette le demeurant sur le
   tapis. 'Messieurs, dit-il, qui en veut?'&mdash;et se l√®ve. Mais ainsi
   qu'il est √† deux pas pr√®s de la porte de vieux cabinet, prend sa
   barbe avec la main droite, et tourne le corps et le feu √† demi
   pour regarder ceux qui le suivoient, fut tout soudain saisi au
   bras par le Sieur de Montsery l'ain√©, qui √©toit pr√®s de la
   chemin√©e, sur l'opinion qu'il ait, que le duc voulut se reculer
   pour se mettre en d√©fense."</p>

<p>The Sieurs des Effranats, de Saint Malines, and de Loignac hasten to
take part in this goodly piece of work, which the Sieur de Montsery the
elder has so gallantly begun. Having the Sieur des Effranats hanging on
his knees, the Sieur de Montsery the elder clinging to his arm, the
Sieur de Saint Malines' dagger sticking in his chest close to his
throat, and the Sieur de Loignac's sword run through his reins, the Duke
for some time drags them all four up and down the chamber; at last he
falls exhausted on the King's bed. Upon this the King&mdash;</p>

   <p class="blockquot">"Etant en son cabinet, leur ayant demand√© s'ils avoient fait, en
   sortit et donna un coup de pied par le visage √† ce pauvre mort."</p>

<p>Surely it was not without good cause that the Duke, a few minutes
before, felt "a chill at his heart."&mdash;</p>

<p>In the next instance I shall cite, the sudden illness forbodes, not any
calamity to the person affected by it, but to the companion of his
journey. It is taken from "Arden of Feversham, his true and lamentable
Tragedy," author unknown, 1592. Arden and his friend Franklin are
travelling by night to Arden's house at Feversham. Franklin is beguiling
the tediousness of the way with a tale. The rest the dramatist shall
relate in his own words:</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>  "<i>Arden.</i> Come, Master Franklin, onward with your tale.</p>
       <p> <i>Frank.</i> I'll assure you, Sir, you task me much:</p>
 <p class="noindent">     A heavy blood is gathered at my heart;</p>
 <p class="noindent"> And on the sudden is my wind so short,</p>
 <p class="noindent">  As hindereth the passage of my speech:</p>
 <p class="noindent">  So fierce a qualm ne'er yet assailed me.</p>
       <p> <i>Arden.</i> Come, Master Franklin, let us go on softly:</p>
 <p class="noindent"> The annoyance of the dust, or else some meat</p>
    <p class="noindent"> You ate at dinner, cannot brook with you.</p>
  <p class="noindent">  I have been often so, and soon amended.</p>
      <p>  <i>Frank.</i> Do you remember where my tale did leave?</p>
        <p><i>Arden.</i> Ay, where the gentleman did check his wife.</p>
     <p>   <i>Frank.</i> She, being reprehended for the fact,</p>
 <p class="noindent">  Witness produced, that took her with the deed,</p>
 <p class="noindent"> Her glove brought in, which there she left behind,</p>
 <p class="noindent"> And many other assured arguments,</p>
 <p class="noindent"> Her husband asked her whether it were not so&mdash;</p>
        <p><i>Arden.</i> Her answer then? I wonder how she looked,</p>
 <p class="noindent"> Having foresworn it with such vehement oaths,</p>
 <p class="noindent"> And at the instant so approved upon her.</p>
       <p> <i>Frank.</i> First she did cast her eyes down on the earth,</p>
  <p class="noindent"> Watching the drops that fell amain from thence:</p>
 <p class="noindent"> Then softly draws she out her handkercher,</p>
   <p class="noindent">   And modestly she wipes her tear stain'd face.</p>
   <p class="noindent">  Then hemm'd she out, to clear her voice it should seem,</p>
    <p class="noindent"> And with a majesty addrest herself</p>
    <p class="noindent">  To encounter all their accusations&mdash;</p>
     <p class="noindent"> Pardon me, Master Arden, I can no more;</p>
     <p class="noindent"> This fighting at my heart makes short my wind.</p>
        <p><i>Arden.</i> Come, we are almost now at Raynham Down;</p>
     <p class="noindent">  Your pretty tale beguiles the weary way:</p>
     <p class="noindent">  I would you were in ease to tell it out."</p>

</div>

<p>Here they are set upon by ruffians, hired by Arden's wife and her
paramour. Arden is killed.&mdash;</p>

<p>In the two preceding instances an affection of the heart is the herald
of misfortune. In <i>Titus Andronicus</i> (Act II., Sc. 4.), Quintus and
Martius are afflicted with a sudden <i>dulness of sight</i>, which seems at
once to be an omen of impending danger, and to facilitate their
succumbing to it.</p>

<h3>
<span>PECULIAR ATTRIBUTES OF THE SEVENTH SON.</span>
</h3>

<p>
Allow me to offer a Note on that part of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. C<span class="smcap lowercase">OOPER'S</span> communication
(Vol. iii., pp. 148, 149.) which relates to the alleged power of the
"seventh son" to cure the "king's evil". This superstition is still
extant in this part of Cornwall. I have recently been told of three
<i>seventh</i> sons, and of one <i>ninth</i> son, who has been in the habit of
touching (or, as it is here called, "<i>striking</i>," which seems to mean
nothing more than <i>stroking</i>) persons suffering from the disease above
referred to.</p>

<p>The <i>striker</i> thrice gently stokes the part affected by the disorder,
and thrice blows on it, using some form of words. One of my informants,
who had been so "struck" when a child, has a charm, or rather an amulet,
which has just, for the first time, been opened at my instigation. It is
a small bag of black silk, and is found to contain an old worn shilling
of William III., bored and stitched through in a piece of canvas. This
was presented to the patient at the time of the operation, and was to be
kept carefully as a preservative against the malady.</p>

<p>In Bristol, about forty years ago, there lived a respectable tradesman
who was habitually known as <i>Dr.</i> Peter P&mdash;&mdash;, with no better title to
his degree than that he was the seventh son of a seventh son.</p>

<p>Those who have read Mr. Carleton's tragic tale, <i>The Black Prophet</i>,
will remember that, in Ireland, the seventh son of the seventh son is
supposed to be&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">And in Keightley's <i>Fairy Mythology</i> (p. 411. <i>note</i>, ed. 1850) are
given some tradition of that gifted<a id="Page_413"></a> <span class="pagenum">[413]</span> Welsh family, the "Jones' of
Muddfi," whose forefather had married the "Spirit of the Van Pool."</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "She left her children behind her, who became famous as doctors.
   Jones was their name, and they lived at a place called Muddfi. In
   them was said to have originated the tradition of the seventh
   son, or Septimus, being born for the healing art; as for many
   generations seven sons were regularly born in each family, the
   seventh of whom became the doctor, and wonderful in his
   profession. It is said, even now, that the Jones' of Muddfi are,
   or were until very recently, clever doctors."
</p>

<p>I have heard this tradition of the Jones' of Muddfi corroborated by a
Welsh friend.</p>

<h3>
<span>FOLK LORE.</span>
</h3>

<h4>
<span><i>Game-feathers protracting the Agony of Death.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In a recent Number this
singular superstition was stated to be prevalent in Sussex. In the
adjoining county of Surrey the notion appears to be deeply rooted in the
minds of the lower classes. A friend, residing in my parish
(Betchworth), has given me several examples, which have fallen under his
notice during the past winter.</p>

<p>"I was calling, a few weeks since, upon an old man whom I had left the
previous day apparently in a dying state. At the door I met an old
neighhour, and inquired if he was still living. 'Yes Sir,' she said; 'we
think he must change his bed.' 'Change his bed!' I replied. 'What do you
mean?' 'Why, Sir, we think he can't pass away while he lies in that bed.
The neighbours think there must be game-feathers in the bed.'
'Game-feathers! What do you mean?' 'Why, Sir, it is always thought a
poor soul can't pass away if he is lying on game-feathers.' 'Oh,' I
said, 'there is nothing in that; that is not the reason of his lingering
on.' 'No, Sir,' she replied, 'I think so too, for I know the bed well. I
was at the making of it, and the feathers were well picked over.'</p>

<p>"Not long after I looked in upon another aged man, who had been confined
to his bed upwards of four months, gently dropping into his grave
without any other apparent complaint than old age. He was a fine, hearty
old man, with a constitution which kept him lingering on beyond
expectation. 'Well,' I said, 'how are you this morning?' 'Oh, Sir, I
have had a sad night. I hoped, when you left me, I should drop asleep
and never wake more in this world.' 'Yes, poor fellow,' said his sister,
who stood by his bedside, 'he does not seem able to die; we think we
must move him to another bed.' 'Another bed! Why so?' 'Why, he does not
seem able to die, and we think there must be wild feathers in his bed.'
The old man evidently thought with his sister, that his bed had
something to do with the protraction of his life. He died, however, at
length without being moved. It is needless to remark, that the
superstition would no doubt have been confirmed, and the flickering lamp
of life might have been extinguished a few hours sooner, had they
carried into effect their proposal to drag him from one bed to another,
or to lay him upon the floor. The woman who helped to lay out the corpse
came to see me, and I took the occasion to ask if she knew the belief,
that a person could not die whilst lying upon game-feathers. She assured
me that she knew it to be the case, and that in two instances, when she
had attended persons who could not die, they had taken them out of their
beds, and they had expired immediately. I found all expostulation in
vain; no argument could shake so strong a conviction, and I have no
doubt that this strange notion is extensively entertained by the
peasantry in these southern counties."</p>

<p>I have since been informed that a similar belief exists in Cheshire, in
regard to pigeons' feathers.</p>

<p>In the part of Surrey where I reside another popular belief still
lingers, noticed elsewhere by writers on superstitions of this nature.
On the decease of the head of a family, where bees are kept, some person
forthwith goes to the hives and informs the bees of the event. Without
this precaution, it is affirmed that they would speedily desert the
hives.</p>

<h3>
<span>BURIALS IN WOOLLEN.</span>
</h3>


<p>On looking over the parish registers of Mautby, in the county of
Norfolk, a few days since, I found thirteen entries of certificates of
the enforced observance of this practice, of which the following is a
specimen:&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "November the 8th, 1678. Was brought unto me an Affidavit for y<span class="topnum">e</span>

 purpose.&mdash;<span class="smaller">ANDREW CALL</span>,

<p>The reason is clear&mdash;to increase the consumption of wool; but I should
much wish to know the date of the aforesaid act of parliament, and to
how late a period it extended. I find a comparatively recent trace of it
in an original affidavit of the kind, in the varied collection of my
friend R. Rising, Esq., of Horsey, which I subjoin in full, as it may be
interesting to many readers of "N. &amp;. Q."</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Unacknowledged Quotations from the Scriptures.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;As a compensation for
the passages which are often held to be in the Bible, but are not there,
it sometimes happens that others are taken from thence, and given to
profane authors. Among these is "Multi pertransibunt, et augebitur
scientia," which, Daniel xii. 4. notwithstanding, is the motto of the
first edition of Montucla's <i>History of Mathematics</i>, followed by
"&mdash;<i>Bacon.</i>" I have also seen it given to Bacon elsewhere.</p>

<span><i>Latin Hexameters on the Bible.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;The doggerel Latin hexameters
subjoined were made by a Christmas party at Billingbear, eighty years
ago. Amongst the contributors I can only point out the names of my
father and Sir Thomas Frankland, the sixth baronet, who printed the
verses for distribution amongst his friends. I have often found them
useful, and they may be perhaps of service to others.</p>

<span><i>Epigram on La Bruy√®re.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;The French Academy has been made the butt of
more sarcastic sallies than any other institution of equal distinction
and respectability. Some of these have been directed against it as a
body, such as Piron's epitaph on himself:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> "Ci-g√Æt Piron qui ne fut rien,</p>
    <p>  Pas m√™me Acad√©micien."</p>

       <p> Ne fallait-il pas un z√©ro?"</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Cock and Bull Story.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;As the expression of a "<i>cock</i> and <i>bull</i> story"
has sometimes puzzled me, so it may have puzzled others, and I therefore
send the following Note, if worthy of notice:</p>

<p>   "I have used the expressive proverbial phrase <i>Cock-on-a-Bell</i>,
   familiarly corrupted into Cock-and-a-Bull, in its true and
   genuine application to the fabulous narratives of Popery. There
   is some measure of antiquarian curiosity attendant upon it, which
   may rival the<a id="Page_415"></a> <span class="pagenum">[415]</span> singular metamorphosis of the <i>Pix und
   Ousel</i> into the familiar sign of the <i>Pig and Whistle</i>. During
   the Middle Ages, as we learn incidentally from Reinerius,
   <i>Gallus-super-campanam</i> was the ecclesiastical hieroglyphic of a
   <i>Romish Priest</i>: and as the gentlemen of that fraternity dealt
   somewhat copiously in legends rather marvellous than absolutely
   true, the contempt of Our English Protestantism soon learned
   proverbially to distinguish any idle figment by the burlesque
   name of a <i>Cock-on-a-Bell</i> story, or, as we now say, a
   <i>Cock-and-a-Bull story</i>."&mdash;From <i>An Inquiry into the History and

<span><i>Mary Queen of Scots&mdash;Her Monument and Head.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;I find in Grose's
<i>Antiquarian Repertory</i>, 2nd edition, vol. iii. p. 388., an account of a
monument which was formerly to be seen in the Church of St. Andrew, at
Antwerp, to the memory of Mary Queen of Scots; and it is therein
related, on the authority of "an ancient MS.," shown to the author by "a
Flemish gentleman of consequence and learning," that two of Mary's
attendant ladies, named Barbara Mowbray and Elizabeth Curle, buried the
head of their unfortunate mistress there, having been permitted, on
leaving England after her execution, to carry her head with them.</p>

<p>Can any of your readers inform me whether this monument still exists,
and whether anything is known of a portrait of Mary said to have been
placed by these ladies near the monument? Also, whether there is any
truth whatever in the above strange story.</p>

<span class="bla">Queries.</span>
</h2>

<h3>
<span>THE BOOK OF JASHER.</span>
</h3>

<p>The inclosed cutting is from the <i>New Monthly Magazine</i> for March 1829.
What has become of the translation of the "Book of Jasher" named
therein, and was it ever published as promised?</p>

<p class="blockquot">"<i>Curious Literary Discovery.</i>&mdash;The following is a singular
   discovery, said to be a translation from the original Hebrew
   manuscript of the Book of Jasher, referred to as a work of credit
   and reputation in Holy Scripture, first in Joshua x. 13. and
   again in 2 Sam. i. 18. This book was kept as a memorial of the
   great events which had happened from the beginning of time,
   especially to the family and descendants of Abraham, by the Kings
   of Judah. After the Babylonish captivity, it fell into the
   possession of the Persian Kings, and was preserved with great
   care in the city of Gazna: from whence a translation was procured
   by the great Alcuin, who flourished in the eighth century, at the
   cost of several bars of gold, presented to those who had the
   custody of it. He brought this translation to his own country,
   having employed, with his companions, seven years in pilgrimage;
   three of which were spent in Gazna, in order to his obtaining
   this important and interesting work. After his return to England
   he was made Abbot of Canterbury; and having lived in the highest
   honour, died in the year 804, leaving this, with other
   manuscripts, to his friend, a clergyman in Yorkshire. It appears
   to have been preserved with religious care for many centuries,
   until, about one hundred years since, it fell into the hands of a
   gentleman, who certifies that on its cover was the following
   testimony of our great reformer Wickliffe:&mdash;'I have read the Book
   of Jasher twice over, and I much approve of it as a piece of
   great antiquity and curiosity; but I cannot assent that it should
   be made a part of the Canon of Scripture.'&mdash;(Signed, Wickliffe.)
   This gentleman, who conceals his name, communicated it to a Noble
   Lord, who appears to have been high in office, when a rumour
   prevailed of a new translation of the Bible. His Lordship's
   opinion of it was that it should be published, as a work of great
   sincerity, plainness, and truth; and further, his Lordship added,
   'it is my opinion the Book of Jasher ought to have been printed
   in the Holy Bible before the Book of Joshua.' From that period
   this invaluable work has lain concealed, until, by an accident,
   it fell into the hands of the present possessor, who purposes to
   publish it in a way worthy its excellence for truth, antiquity,
   and evident originality.&mdash;<i>Daily Paper.</i>"</p>

  <p class="right"> L. L. L.</p>

<p class="blockquot">[Two editions of this work have been published: the first
   appeared in 1751, and the other in 1829; both in 4to. The
   title-page of the latter edition informs us that it was
   "translated into English from the Hebrew, by Flaccus Albinus
   Alcuinus of Britain, Abbot of Canterbury, who went a pilgrimage
   into the Holy Land and Persia, where he discovered this volume,
   in the city of Gazna." But it appears that this Alcuin of Britain
   was no other than Jacob Ilive; and, according to Rowe Mores, the
   whole of it is a palpable forgery. He states, that "the account
   given of the translation is full of glaring absurdities. Mr.
   Ilive, in the night-time, had constantly an Hebrew Bible before
   him, and cases in his closet. He produced the <i>Book of Jasher</i>;
   and it was composed in private, and the same worked off in the
   night-time in a private press-room."&mdash;Rowe Mores' <i>Diss. on
   Founders</i>, p. 64. See also Nichols' <i>Literary Anecdotes</i>, vol. i.
   p. 309.]</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Old China.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;It was gratifying to see some inquiries respecting Dutch
china, which it is to be hoped will lead to a further pursuit of such
subjects. Some connoisseur would confer a benefit upon the community if
he would be kind enough to give a concise description of the various
styles and to point out the distinguishing marks of old china generally,
by which its beauties might be appreciated and its value estimated:
there is great difficulty in acquiring such information.</p>

<span><i>Pagoda, Joss House, Fetiche.</i></span>

<p>&mdash;No such word as <i>Pagoda</i> is known in the

i.<a id="Page_416"></a> <span class="pagenum">[416]</span> p. 25.), is the proper name. I have read somewhere or another
that <i>Pagoda</i> is a name invented by the Portuguese from the Persian
"Pentgheda," meaning <i>a temple of idols</i>. <i>Joss</i>, applied to the Chinese
temples, seems to be the Spanish <i>Di√≥s</i> (Deus), as <i>diurnal</i> becomes
<i>journal</i>.</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "The Fetiche of the African (says Mr. Milman) is the Manitou of
   the American Indian. The word <i>Fetiche</i> was first, I believe,

     <p> Yes! thou art fled, but if 'tis given</p>

<p>I have never since, through a tolerably extensive course of reading, met
with the poem to which these lines belong, and have inquired of others,
without more success. Can any of your correspondents inform me of the

<span><i>Hearne's Confirmation.&mdash;Baxter's Heavy Shove.&mdash;Old Ballad.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In
<i>Narratives of Sorcery and Magic</i>, by Thomas Wright, Esq. (1851), vol.
ii. p. 163., mention is made of a work by the associate of the notorious
Hopkins, the "Witch-finder General," one John Hearne, entitled, <i>A
Confirmation and Discovery of Witchcraft</i> (1648). I should esteem it a
great favour if any of the numerous readers of your valuable journal can
inform me where a copy of Hearne's work is to be found, as it appears to
be wanting in the British Museum, and several other of the public
libraries. I already happen to possess a copy of Matthew Hopkins's
<i>Discovery of Witches</i>, 4to. (1647), an extraordinary little work, which
Sir Walter Scott acknowledges he was acquainted with but by name.</p>

<p>There is a tract, too, by the celebrated author of the <i>Saints' Rest</i>,
which I never yet could put eyes on, though I have for some years
"collected" rather largely; I allude to Baxter's <i>Heavy Shove</i>,
mentioned at page 99. of Lackington's "Life," and in one or two other
works; but among a very large collection of old editions of Baxter's
works possessed by me, it is not to be discovered. If any of your
correspondents can enlighten me upon the subject I shall be much
gratified.</p>

<p>Though I have collected rather extensively among the ballad lore of this
country, I am sorry to say I never could find out from what particular
ballad the annexed stanza is derived. It is to be found, as an epigraph,
in <i>Poetical Memoirs</i>, by the late James Bird, 8vo. (1823):</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Ednowain ap Bradwen.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Can any of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." give me
information respecting this person, or the family descended from him,
which is supposed to have lived in North Wales during the reign of Henry
VII.? His armorial badge is figured in p. 250. of Enderbie's <i>Cambria
Triumphans</i>, and is described as <i>Gules, three snakes braced, Arg.</i>
There is an ancient font in our church, which, when restored to it in
the year 1841, after having been put to vile uses for many years, did
bear this badge, <i>but it does not bear it now</i>. The gentleman who
undertook the direction of the repair of the sculpture on the font, not
having been inspired by the Professor of History at Oxford with a due
reverence for antiquities, ordered Samuel Davies, a stone-mason (who is
still living in this town), to make the three snakes as much like one
dragon as he could. This he attempted to do by chiselling away the head
of one snake, inlaying in its place the head of a dragon; and making the
other heads and tails into legs with claws. The result of these
operations has been a dragon of a <i>very</i> singular appearance. There is a
portcullis with chains sculptured on one of the eight sides of the font;
and it has been conjectured that the motive to the conversion of the
<i>three snakes, braced</i>, into a dragon, was to make it appear probable
that the font had been presented to the church by Henry VII.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Mummy Wheat.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;As you have afforded space for a Query on "Wild Oats,"
you will not, I hope, deny me a corner for one on Mummy Wheat.</p>

<p>In the year 1840, a letter appeared in <i>The Times</i>, signed "Martin
Farquhar Tupper," which detailed minutely the sowing, growing, and
gathering of some mummy wheat. Mr. Tupper, it seems, had received the
grains of wheat from Mr. Pettigrew, who had them from Sir Gardner
Wilkinson, by whom they were found on opening an ancient tomb in the
Thebaid. Mr. Tupper took great pains to secure the identity of the seed,
and had no doubt that he had gathered the product of a grain preserved
since the time of the Pharaohs. The long vitality of seeds has been a
popular belief; I was therefore surprised to find that that interesting
fact is now pronounced to be no fact at all. It appears, in <i>The
Year-Book of Facts for 1852</i>, that Prof. Henslowe stated to the British
Association, that "the instances of plants growing from seeds found in
mummies were all erroneous." Can any one tell me how this has been
proved?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Ghost&mdash;Evidence of one not received.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;In Ackerman's <i>Repository</i>, Nov.
1820, is a short account of a remarkable instance of a person being
tried on the pretended evidence of a ghost. A farmer on his return from
the market at Southam, co. Warwick, was murdered. The next morning a man
called upon the farmer's wife, and related how on the previous night, as
he lay in bed, quite awake, her husband's ghost had appeared to him, and
after showing him several stabs on his body, had told him that he was
murdered by a certain person, and his corpse thrown into a certain
marl-pit. A search was instituted, the body found in the pit, and the
wounds on the body of the deceased were exactly in the parts described
by the pretended dreamer; the person who was mentioned was committed for
trial on violent suspicion of murder, and the trial came on at Warwick
before Lord Chief Justice Raymond. The jury would have convicted the
prisoner as rashly as the magistrate had committed him, but for the
interposition of the judge, who told them that he did not put any credit
in the pretended ghost story, since the prisoner was a man of
unblemished reputation, and<a id="Page_418"></a> <span class="pagenum">[418]</span> no ill feeling had ever existed
between himself and the deceased. He said that he knew of no law which
admitted of the evidence of a ghost; and if any did, the ghost had not
appeared. The crier was then ordered to summon the ghost, which he did
three times, and the judge then acquitted the prisoner, and caused the
accuser to be detained, which was accordingly done, and his house
searched, when such strong proofs of guilt were discovered, that the man
confessed the crime, and was executed for murder at the following
assizes.</p>

<p>Could any of your readers inform me when this remarkable trial took
place, and where I could meet with a more detailed account?</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Roman and Saxon Cambridge.</i></span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Dr. W. Warren, formerly Vice-Master of
Trinity Hall, Cambridge, wrote some papers to prove that the situation
of the Grantac√¶ster of Bede was at the Castle end of Cambridge, not at
Granchester, and "demonstrated the thing as amply as a matter of that
sort is capable of." Brydges states (<i>Restituta</i>, iv. 388.) that his
brother, Dr. R. Warren, intended to publish this tract, which came into
his hands after the death of the vice-master, which happened in, or
shortly after, the year 1735. He left some MSS. to the college, but this
is not amongst them; and Dr. R. Warren did not, as far as I can learn,

<h4>
<span><i>Queries on the Mistletoe</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. iv., p. 110.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Will your correspondent
who some Numbers back stated, in a communication on the mistletoe, that
it was <i>not uncommon</i> upon the oak in <i>Somersetshire</i>, kindly give <i>two
or three localities</i> on his own knowledge? I fear some mistake has
arisen, for, as far as my experience goes, an arch-Druid might hunt long
enough in the present day for the "heaven-descended plant" among a
<i>grove of oaks</i>, ere he fortuitously alighted upon it. Some years ago a
friend assured me that he was credibly informed by a timber merchant
often in the Sussex forests, that <i>mistletoe</i> was not uncommon upon oaks
there; but on a personal inspection it turned out that <i>ivy</i>, not
<i>mistletoe</i>, was intended. I suspect a similar mistake in Somersetshire,
unless two or three certain localities can be named as seen by a
competent observer.</p>

<p>I should also like to know from your Carolinian correspondent H. H. B.,
whether the mistletoe he mentions is our genuine "wintry mistletoe"&mdash;the
<i>Viscum album</i> of Linn√¶us, or <i>another species</i>. The "varieties of the
oak" he speaks of as having mistletoe upon them, are, I presume, all
<i>American</i> species, and not the European <i>Quercus robur</i>.</p>

<p><i>Saint Richard</i> (Vol. iv., p. 475.).&mdash;On what authority do the
particulars recorded of this personage in the <i>Lives of the Saints</i>
rest? I cannot help considering his very existence as rather apocryphal,
for these reasons:&mdash;1. Bede, who must have been his contemporary, and
whose <i>Ecclesiastical History</i> was written several years after the date
assigned for Richard's death, never mentions his name. 2. When did his
alleged renunciation of the throne occur, and what historian of the
period mentions it? At the time of his death, and for thirty-five years
before, the kingdom of Wessex was under the sway of Ina, one of the
greatest and best of the West Saxon kings. 3. His name is not a Saxon
one, and I believe it is not to be found in English history till after
the Norman Conquest.</p>

  <p class="right">S. S. W<span class="smcap lowercase">ARDEN</span>.</p>


<p class="blockquot">  [The <i>Britannia Sancta</i>, 4to. 1745, contains the following notice
   of St. Richard compiled from the collections of the
   Bollandists:&mdash;"St. Richard, whose name occurs on Feb. 7 in the
   Roman Martyrology, is styled there, as well as in divers other
   monuments, <i>King of the English</i>, though in the catalogues of our
   Saxon kings there is no one found of that name; the reason of
   which is, because the catalogues of the kings, during the
   Heptarchy, are very imperfect, as might be proved, if it were
   necessary, by several instances of kings whose names are there
   omitted. As for St. Richard, it is that he was one of those
   princes who, as we learn from St. Bede, lib. iv. ch. 12., ruled
   the West Saxons after the year 673, till they were forced to give
   way to King Ceadwall; which is the more probable, because he
   flourished about that time, and was of the province of the West
   Saxons, as appears from his being a kinsman to St. Winifred, or
   Boniface, born and brought up in those parts (at Crediton in
   Devonshire), and from his son Willibald's being brought up in a
   monastery of the same province, and from his own setting out upon
   his pilgrimage from Hamble Haven, which belonged to the West
   Saxons." Some account of St. Richard and his tomb at Lucca will
   be found in the <i>Gentleman's Magazine</i>, vol. lxix., pt. i. p.

<p>There appears to be a slight error in the Editor's reply to E. D.'s
Query respecting Ralph Winterton's translation of Gerard's <i>Meditations
and Prayers</i>. I have an earlier edition than that of 1631. It is dated
1627,<a id="ted3"></a><a title="Go to footnote 3." href="#fn3" class="fnanchor">[3]</a> printed at Cambridge by Thomas and John Bucke, and possesses no
less than four dedications, which throw some little, and rather curious
light on his history. The <i>first</i>, "To the Right Worsh. my most worthy
Friend and Benefactour, Mr. John Bowle, Doctor of Divinitie, and Deane
of Salisbury," in which he mentions "the fatherly care" he had
experienced from that divine, "when he was at Kensington, in the house
of that most vertuous and literate Lady, the Lady Coppen." "By your
indeficient liberalitie," he says, "all defects were supplyed, all
difficulties remooved, horses provided, a man appointed, and, <i>to
conclude</i>, by the grace of God, after many a troublesome and wearysome
step, to my rest I returned." The <i>second</i> Dedication is, "To the Right

T. Coppen, her Sonnes; M<span class="topnum">ris</span> Elizabeth Coppen, her Daughter-in-Law,

"scarce had he entered her doores at Kensington, but he was saluted and
made welcome by a gentlewoman well deserving at his hands, whose name
must not be concealed, M<span class="topnum">ris</span> Francis Thorowgood, who hasted to carrie
news to your Ladyship. <i>Dixirat et dicto citius.</i> Hereupon your

business, not to send to mee, but to descend yourself to mee; not so
much by the degrees of staires, as by a naturall inclination to show
your hospitality," &amp;c.; and speaks of her as understanding "the
scholler's Languages as well as they that do profess them;" and as being
"highly honoured by Queene Elizabeth." The <i>third</i> Dedication is "To the
Right Worship. my most munificent Friend, Sir John Hanburie, of Kelmash,
in Northamptonshire." The <i>fourth</i>, "To the Worsh. my very worthy

<h3>
<span>MEANING AND ORIGIN OF "ERA."<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 383. 454.; Vol. v., p. 106.)</span>
</h3>


<p>Your correspondents do not seem to be aware that this <i>questio vexata</i>
has given rise to a volume in folio! In 1744 Don Gregorio Mayans y
Siscar published, at the expense of the Academy of Valencia, a volume
containing nearly 400 pages under the following title: <i>Obras
Chronologicas de Don Gaspar Iba&ntilde;es, &amp;c., Marquis de Mondejar, &amp;c. &amp;c.</i>,
which is principally occupied by a discourse entitled, "Origen de
 <span class="smaller">LA ERA ESPA&Ntilde;OLA</span> i su Diferencia con los a&ntilde;os de Christo."<a id="sto4"></a><a title="Go to footnote 4." href="#fn4" class="fnanchor">[4]</a> Prefixed to this
is a very able and learned Preface, by the editor, of nearly 100 pages;
and one would have thought that between these distinguished scholars the
subject in dispute would be set at rest.</p>

<p class="footnote"><a id="fn4"></a><a title="Return to text." href="#sto4" class="label">[4]</a> A re-impression of the Valencia edition was
 made at Madrid in the year 1795.</p>

<p>Unfortunately, however, Spanish scholars and antiquaries have too much
neglected the Gothic element in their language, and they have
consequently missed the only source from whence, as it appears to me,
the true origin of <i>Era</i> could be developed. The Marquis de Mondejar
indeed seems to have had a suspicion of the true source; for he has a
chapter thus entitled "Si puede ser <i>Gothica</i> la voz
 <span class="smaller">ERA</span> i aver
introducido los Godos su computo en Espa&ntilde;a?" in which he thus expresses
his incapacity to answer his own question:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "I assi contentandonos con aver expressado nuestra imaginacion
   con el mismo recelo que la discurrimos, <i>prohibendonos la
   ignorancia de la lengua Gothica antigua</i>, el que podamos
   justificar si pudo aver procedido de ella la voz
 <span class="smaller">ERA</span> propria del
   computo de que hablamos."</p>

<p>As long since as 1664 that eminent northern philologist Thomas Marshall,
in his notes on the Gothic Gospels, had thus expressed himself,
confirming, if not anticipating, Spelman:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "{jER} proprie significat annum, sicque usurpatur in omnibus
   linguis Gothic√¶ cognatis; su√¢ scilicet cuique Dialecto asservat√¢.
   Videant Hispani, nunquid eorum
 <span class="smaller">HERA</span> vel
 <span class="smaller">ERA</span>, quod <i>√Ütatem</i> et
   <i>tempus</i> dicitur interdum significare, debeat originationem suam
   Gothico {jER}, atque num forsan hinc quoque aliquid lucis
   affulserit indagantibus originem vexatissimi illius <i>√Üra</i>,
   quatenus significat Epocham Chronologicam."</p>

<p>In the <i>Glossary</i> the further development of the origin of the word is
ingenious, but not satisfactory:</p>

  <p class="blockquot"> "Prisca interim Gothorum atque Anglo-Saxonum orthographi√¢ inducor
   ut credam {ger} vel {gear} esse √† <span title="[Greek: gyroun]">&#947;&#965;&#961;&#959;&#8166;&#957;</span> Gyrare, in orbem
   circumvolvere, juxta illud poet√¶ principis, <i>Georg</i>.
<span class="smaller">II.</span> 402.:</p>

<div class="poem">

</div>

<p class="blockquot">"ubi Servius: Annus dictus quasi Anus, id est Anulus; quod in se
   redeat, &amp;c."</p>


<p>That the Roman word <i>√Üra</i> signified <i>number</i> in earlier times, we learn
from Nonius Marcellus:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "<i>√Üra</i> numeri nota, Lucilius lib. xxviiij. Hoc est ratio
   perversa, <i>√¶ra</i> summa, et subducta improbe."</p>


<p>Those who desire further confirmation will find it in that extraordinary
storehouse of erudition, the <i>Exercitationes Pliniana</i> of Salmasius, p.
483., ed. 1689.</p>

<p>It is equally certain that, soon after the establishment of the Gothic
domination in Spain, it was applied in its present signification; but
that it also signified <i>time</i> or period will be evident from the
following passage of the <i>Coronica General</i>, Zamora, 1541. fol.
<span class="smaller">CCC.XXVJ</span>. Speaking of the numbers of the extraordinary armament
assembled by Don Alonzo, preparatory to the battle of Las Navas:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "E para todo esto complir avia menester el rey Don Alfonso de
   cada dia doze mil maravedis <i>de aquella</i>
 <span class="smaller">ERA</span>, que era buena
   moneda."</p>

<p class="noindent">That is to say, money <i>of that time</i>.<a id="Page_421"></a> <span class="pagenum">[421]</span></p>

<p>From our imperfect acquaintance with the early history of the Goths, it
is not easy to decide upon the reasons why they adopted their mode of
reckoning from thirty-eight years before the Christian epoch; but if we
accept the signification which we know it was not unusual to affix to
the word <i>Era</i>, namely, that of <i>year</i>, <i>time</i>, or <i>period</i>, the
solution is easy as to its origin. It was only the engrafting of their
own vernacular word into the barbarous Latin of the time, from whence
also it was adopted into the Romance, Castilian, or Spanish.</p>

<p>It may also be observed that Liutprand uses the word in this sense: in
speaking of the Mosque of San Sophia at Constantinople, and how the
course of the reign of its rulers was noted there, so as to be manifest
to all, he concludes:</p>

<p class="blockquot">  "Sic <span class="smaller">√ÜRAM</span> qui non viderunt intelligunt."</p>


<p>So Dudo, <i>De Actis Normannorum</i>, lib. v. p. 111.:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "Transacta denique duarum <i>Herarum</i> intercapedine, mirabilibusque
   incrementis augmentata profusus Ricardo Infante, c&oelig;pit Dux
   Willelmus de Regni commodo salubriter tractare."</p>

<p>It is also remarkable that we find it in use only in those places under
the domination of the Goths, as in the southern provinces of
France,&mdash;the Council of Arles, for instance.&mdash;<i>V. Mansi Collect.
Concil.</i>, t. xiv. col. 57.</p>

<p>The earliest inscription in which it has been found was at Lebrija, in
the kingdom of Seville, and the date corresponds with that of the year
465 from the birth of Christ. It runs thus:</p>

<div class="poem">

     <p> ALEXANDRA . CLARISSIMA . FEMINA</p>
      <p>VIXIT . ANNOS . PLVS . MINVS . XXV</p>
      <p>RECESSIT . IN . PACE. X . KAL . IANVAR</p>
      <p>ERA . DIII . PROBVS . FILIVS . VIXIT</p>
    <p>  ANNOS . DVOS . MENSEM . VNVM.</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">It is possible there may be some error even here, for no other
inscription yet recorded is so early by eighty years.</p>

<p>Had it been in use at an earlier period, the Spaniard, Paulus Orosius,
whose <i>History</i> ends with <span class="smaller">A.D</span>. 417, would doubtless have used it;
whereas we find that he makes use of the <i>Anno Mundi</i>, of the Olympiads,
and of the <i>A.U.C.</i> of the Romans.</p>

<p>All circumstances, therefore, considered, we may safely conclude that in
the Spanish <i>Era</i> we have nothing more than the adoption of the <i>jera</i>
of Ulfilas, by whom it is used for <span title="[Greek: etos]">&#7956;&#964;&#959;&#962;</span> and
<span title="[Greek: kronos]">&#967;&#961;&#8057;&#957;&#959;&#962;</span>.
The Gothic word being written with the consonant <i>j</i> {j} will account
for the form in which, to mark the aspiration, <i>Era</i> is often found with
the initial <i>H</i>. Whoever may desire to trace the etymology further will
do well to consult Dieffenbach's very valuable <i>Vergleichendes
W√∂rterbuch der Gothischen Sprache</i>.</p>

<span>LADY ARABELLA STUART.<br />

<p>It may be interesting to some of the readers of "N. &amp; Q." to peruse the
following observations made by the Venetian ambassador resident in
England in 1606, respecting that "child of woe" the Lady Arabella
Stuart, whose romantic history forms one of the most pleasing of
D'Israeli's <i>Curiosities of Literature</i>. The extract I send you is taken
from a little French work, which professes to be a translation from the
manuscript "Italian Relation of England" by Marc-Antonio Correr, the
Venetian ambassador, and was printed at Montb√©liard in 1668. The Lady
Arabella is here spoken of as <i>Madame Isabelle</i>.</p>


<p class="blockquot">  "La personne la plus proche de sang de sa Majest√© apr√®s ses

   en perfection, s√ßavoir le Latin, l'Italien, le Fran√ßois, et
   l'Espagnol; elle entend le Grec et l'Hebreu, et estudie sans

   prenant jalousie de tout le monde, et principalement de ceux qui
   avoient quelque pretention √† la couronne, luy osta sous divers
   pretextes, la plus grand part de ses revenus; c'est pourquoy la
   pauvre Dame ne peut pas vivre dans la splendeur, et n'a pas le
   moyen de faire du bien √† ceux qui la servent, comme elle
   voudroit. Le Roy t√©moigne avoir de l'affection et de l'estime
   pour elle, le laissant vivre en cour, ce que la Reyne deffunte ne

<p><i>Her Flight.</i>&mdash;Phineas Pette, the shipwright at Chatham, received orders
to assist in the capture of the unfortunate lady; and it would appear,
from his manuscript Diary (<i>Harl. MS.</i> 6279.), that he did his best to
execute them. His statement is as follows:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">"The 4th of June (1611), being Tuesday, being prepared to have
   gone to London the next day, about midnight one of the King's
   messengers was sent down to me from the Lord Treasurer to man the
   light horsemen [Query, what kind of boats were these?] with 20
   musquetteers, and to run out as low as the Noor Head to search
   all shipps, barks, and other vessells for the Lady Arabella that
   had then made a scape, and was bound over for France; which
   service I performed accordingly, and searched Queenborough, and
   other vessells I could meet withall; then went over to Lee, in
   Essex, and searched the Towne; and when we could hear no news of
   her went to Gravesend, and thence took post-horse to Greenwich,
   where his Majesty then lay, and delivered the account of my
   journey to the Lord Treasurer by his Maj<span class="topnum">ties</span> command, and soe

<h3>
<span>NEWTON, CICERO, AND GRAVITATION.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 344.)</span>
</h3>


<p>"When shall we three meet again?" Let no one smile at your
correspondent's question, for the common mode of stating Newton's claim
makes it natural enough to ask whether the ancients were aware that
bodies fall to the earth, and to produce proof that they had such
knowledge. But Cicero had more: he not only knew the fall of bodies, but
he had a <i>medius locus mundi</i>, or <i>centrum mundi</i>, as it was afterwards
called, to which bodies must fall. This was his law of gravitation, and
that of his time. Without describing the successive stages of the
existence of this centre, it may be enough here to state, that a part of
Newton's world-wide renown arises from his having cashiered this
immovable point from the solar system, and sent it on its travels in
search of the real centre of gravity of the whole universe. Newton
substituted, for the old law of gravitation <i>towards a centre</i>, his law
of <i>universal</i> gravitation, namely, that <i>every</i> particle gravitates
towards every other. There had been some idea of such a law in the minds
of speculative men: it was Newton who showed that one particular law,
namely, that of the inverse square of the distance, would entail upon a
system, all whose particles are subject to it, those very motions which
are observed in our system. Cicero would have been startled to know
that, when a body falls towards the earth, the earth rises towards it,
<i>medius locus</i> and all: not quite so fast, it is true, nor so far. But
it must not be supposed that we could move our earth any distance in
course of time by continually dropping heavy weights upon it; for the
truth is, that when the weight is raised the earth is a little lowered,
or at least made to move the other way. Archimedes said that, with a
place to stand on, he could move the earth; not aware that he was doing
it at the time he spoke, by the motion of his arm.</p>

   <p class="right">   M.</p>


<p>May I ask your correspondent S. E. B. where he has discovered that the
<i>world-wide reputation</i> of Newton was founded upon a notion of his being
the first person who pointed out that bodies are attracted, or seem to
be attracted, towards the centre of the earth? and, on the other hand,
what traces there are in Cicero of the <i>real</i> "law of gravity," which
Newton <i>did</i> discover, and with such immense labour demonstrate and
illustrate, namely, that attraction (that is, not to the centre of the
earth or world in particular, but between every particle of matter and
the rest) varies inversely as the square of the distance?</p>

<p>To come to a minor question; your correspondent reads the passage <i>qua
delata gravitate</i>&mdash;so I should read, decidedly. The whole sentence,
which is a long one, is a series of questions (which, by-the-bye, is an
additional reason against quoting it as an assertion).</p>

<p class="blockquot">"Inde est indagatio nata ... unde essent omnia orta ... qu√¶que
   cujusque generis ... origo qu√¶ vita, ... qu√¶que ex alio in aliud
   vicissitudo ... unde terra, et quibus librata ponderibus, quibus
   cavernis maria sustineantur; qua omnia, delata gravitate, medium
   mundi locum semper expetant."</p>


<p>It is <i>in qua</i> in Ernesti, unnoticed. <i>In</i> was inserted by those who
thought that <i>qua</i> agreed with <i>terra</i>; which, if otherwise probable, is
negatived by the use of the word <i>mundi</i> in the clause.</p>

 <p class="right">  C. B.</p>

<p>Sir Isaac Newton's discovery was the law of <i>universal</i> gravitation,
viz. that the solar system is kept together by the gravity of the
heavenly bodies towards the sun. This was founded on <i>terrestrial</i>
gravitation, of which the falling apple <i>put him in mind</i>, applied first
to the moon, and then <i>universally</i> to the universe. (See <i>Penny
Cyclop√¶dia</i>, art. "Gravitation;" Biot, "Life of Newton," in the
<i>Biographie Universelle</i>; or the translation of it in the "Life of
Newton" in the <i>Library of Useful Knowledge</i>, p. 5.) This is very
different from Cicero's words; in which<a id="ich5"></a><a title="Go to footnote 5." href="#fn5" class="fnanchor">[5]</a> (<i>sc.</i> the earth) all things
borne downwards by their weight ever seek to reach the middle point of
the universe, which is also the lowest point in the earth (qui est idem
infimus in rotundo).</p>

<h3>
<span>DEFERRED EXECUTIONS.<br />
(Vol. iv., pp. 191. 243.)</span>
</h3>



<p>Although your correspondent E. S. attempts to throw discredit on M. W.
B.'s narration of a deferred execution at Winchester, and carps at the
mention of a "warrant," as if that militated against the fact; yet
doubtless, in times when carelessness among official personages was not
uncommon, many deferred executions may have taken place.</p>

<p>It must be evident, that in the case of a convict <i>respited during
pleasure</i>, that <i>an order</i> must at last be formally made for such
person's execution or commutation of punishment; during which interval
the prisoner would remain in custody of the gaoler. This in effect would
be tantamount to a<a id="Page_423"></a> <span class="pagenum">[423]</span> warrant, and of course communicated to the
unfortunate delinquent.</p>

<p>A case somewhat similar to the Winchester one was told me by an old and
respectable inhabitant of Worcester, who was himself cognisant of the
circumstance, and had frequently seen the convict. It occurred in the
gaolership of the father of the present governor of the city gaol. A boy
of only thirteen or fourteen had been convicted of some capital offence,
but on account of his youth was respited indefinitely. He remained in
the gaol, was found to be a docile lad, and much liberty was accorded to
him; the authorities expecting that he would receive a pardon. Time flew
on, many months&mdash;I think my informant said nearly two years elapsed, and
his case seemed forgotten. If he was not actually sent on errands out of
the gaol, so loose was his captivity, that he might easily have slipt
away at any time, and been scarcely missed. In fact, he had the full run
of the prison, and was a great favourite with the debtors, whose sports
and amusements he joined in, for discipline was very lax in those days.
He was playing at ball one day in the yard with some debtors, full of
life and glee, when suddenly, to the utter astonishment of the gaoler,
and the awe of his associates, there came an order from London for his
execution. Why he had remained so long forgotten, or why such extreme
severity fell on him so unexpectedly at last, none could tell; but his
case was considered a very hard one, and was commiserated by the whole
city. My informant saw the poor boy conducted to execution. The old
citizen who gave me this account is dead, or I could have recovered the
date of its occurrence.</p>

<p>I observe that the substance of M. W. B.'s Note has been reprinted in a
mutilated form in several newspapers; his preliminary remark, and
concluding Query, being omitted! The effect of this is to circulate as a
<i>fact</i> what your correspondent himself questions. My object however in
this communication, is not so much to draw attention to the injurious
effects of partial quotation, as to point out what, in my opinion,
renders the occurrence of an execution under the circumstances detailed
a manifest impossibility. I believe I am correct in stating that there
never was, nor is there now (out of London), such a thing as a <i>warrant</i>
for the <i>execution of a criminal</i>. At the close of each Assize, a fair
copy of the <i>Calendar</i>, with the sentences in the margin, is signed by
the Judges, and left with the sheriff; this is the <i>only authority</i> he
has given him; and in the event of a sentence of death, he has no
alternative but carrying it into effect; unless he receives from the
Crown a pardon, a reprieve, or a warrant commuting the sentence.
<i>Blackstone</i> observes upon this:</p>

<p class="blockquot"> "It may afford matter of speculation, that in civil causes there
   should be such a variety of writs of execution to recover a
   trifling debt, issued in the king's name, and under the seal of
   the court, without which the sheriff cannot legally stir one
   step; and yet that the <i>execution of a man</i>, the most important
   and terrible task of any, <i>should depend upon a marginal note</i>."</p>

<h3>
<span>DUCHESS OF LANCASTER.<br />
(Vol. v., p. 320.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Your correspondent is alarmed lest the honour he claims for the
Lancastrians should be denied them, because it has been "discovered that
William III. never created himself Duke of Lancaster." Where is it
asserted that either he or any other of our sovereigns ever did? When
Henry of Bolingbroke merged the lesser name of duke in the greater name
of king, he was no more Duke of Lancaster than he was Earl of Derby or
Duke of Hereford; but the title of Duke of Lancaster he willed not to be
lost altogether as the others were, and therefore by an act of
parliament (1 Hen. IV., Art. 81.) it was enacted <i>Que le Prince porte le
nom de Duc de Lancastre</i>. The act, after reciting that "our said Lord
the King, considering how Almighty God of his great grace had placed him
in the honorable Estate of King, and nevertheless he cannot yet for
certain cause bear the name of Duke of Lancaster," then ordains that
"Henry his eldest son should have and bear the name of Duke of
Lancaster, and that he be named Prince of Wales, Duke of Aquitaine, of
Lancaster, and of Cornwall, and Earl of Chester." The fact is, that the
King or Queen of England cannot be Duke or Duchess in the realm of
England. Our kings have held inferior titles drawn from other kingdoms,
as Duke of Normandy and Earl of Anjou; but Lord Coke says the sovereign
cannot be <i>rex</i> and <i>dux</i> in the same realm. The Queen, as queen, holds
her palatinate of Lancaster, and the other duchy lands and franchises;
but she holds them <i>jure ducatus</i>, so distinguished from those estates
which she holds <i>jure coron√¶</i>. She cannot however properly be styled
Duchess of Lancaster.</p>

   <p class="right"> W. H.</p>


<p>In your last Number (Vol. v., p. 320.) is an inquiry on the Duchess of
Lancaster. The best answer to this is to be found in a book, 8vo.,
entitled <i>Harrison on Crown Revenues, or a Memoir, &amp;c. respecting the
Revenues of the Duchies of Cornwall and Lancaster</i>: no date or printer's
name. I purchased a copy at a sale a short time ago. Everything will be
ascertained here perhaps better than any where else.</p>

  <p class="right">J. D.</p>

<p>Is Queen Victoria the possessor of this title? It would appear so. Sir
N. Harris Nicolas, in his<a id="Page_424"></a> <span class="pagenum">[424]</span> <i>Synopsis of the Peerage</i>, speaking of
the dukedom, says:</p>

 <p class="blockquot">  "1399. Henry Plantagenet, son and heir, ascended the throne 29th
   Sept. 1399; when this title, with all his other honours, became
   merged in the crown, in which it has ever since remained vested."</p>

<p>Your correspondent may be referred to <i>Blackstone</i> (Introd. ¬ß4.), where
is a very interesting account of the Palatinate and Duchy of Lancaster.
We are there told that on his succession to the crown, Henry IV. was too
prudent to suffer his Duchy of Lancaster to be united to the crown, and
therefore he procured an act of parliament ordaining that this duchy and
his other hereditary estates&mdash;</p>

 <p class="blockquot"> "Should remain to him and his heirs for ever, and should remain,
   descend, be administered, and governed in like manner as if he
   had never attained the regal dignity."</p>


<p>In the first of Edward IV., Henry VI. was attainted, and the Duchy of
Lancaster declared forfeited to the crown. At the same time an act was
passed to continue the county palatine, and to make the same part of the
duchy; and to vest the whole in King Edward IV. and his heirs, <i>kings of
England</i>, for ever. Blackstone then mentions that in the first Henry
VII. an act was passed vesting the Duchy of Lancaster in that king and
his heirs; and in a note examines the question whether the duchy vested
in the natural or political person of the king. He then says:</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "It seems to have been understood very early after the statute of
   Henry VII., that the Duchy of Lancaster was by no means thereby
   made a separate inheritance from the royal patrimony, since it
   descended, with the crown, to the half-blood in the instances of
   Queens Mary and Elizabeth; which it could not have done as the
   estate of a mere Duke of Lancaster in the common course of legal
   descent."</p>

<p>If, in saying that William III. never created himself Duke of Lancaster,
your correspondent means that he caused no patent to issue granting
himself that dignity, he is, I doubt not, correct. But if, after the
above quotations, any doubt could remain on the subject, possibly the
following extract from the act 1 Will. &amp; Mar. sess. 2. cap. 2. ("An Act
declaring the Rights and Liberties of the Subject, and settling the
Succession of the Crown") will sufficiently dispel it:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "And the said Lords Spiritual and Temporal and Commons seriously
   considering, &amp;c., do hereby recognise, acknowledge, and declare,
   that King James II. having abdicated the Government, and their
   Majesties having accepted the Crown and Royal dignity as
   aforesaid, their said Majesties did become, were, and are, and of
   right ought to be, by the laws of this realm, our sovereign liege
   lord and lady the King and Queen of England, France, and Ireland,
   and the dominions thereunto belonging, in and to whose princely
   persons the Royal state, crown, and dignity of the said realms,
   with all <i>honours</i>, <i>styles</i>, <i>titles</i>, regalities, prerogatives,
   powers, jurisdictions, and authorities to the same belonging and
   appertaining, are most rightfully and entirely invested and
   incorporated, united and annexed."</p>

<p>In conclusion, will you allow me to ask some correspondent to set forth
at length the titles of our Sovereign Lady the Queen? In confessing that
I do not know, I fancy that I state the case as regards the majority of
the lieges of her Majesty. Indeed, a tale sometime ago went "the round
of the papers," to the effect that the "Duke of Rothsay" was one day
announced to his Royal Highness Prince Albert. The prince, who was not
aware of the existence of such a personage, at length ordered him to be
admitted, and was not a little astonished at beholding his eldest son!
This, though doubtless the coinage of some ingenious but hungry
penny-a-liner, pre-supposes so large an amount of general ignorance on
the subject, that I hope some well-informed individual will, through
your columns, enlighten the world on the point.</p>

<h3>
<span>SURNAMES.<br />
(Vol. v., pp. 290. 326.)</span>
</h3>

<p>Variations of surnames occur much later than the close of the fourteenth
century, the period cited by your correspondent C<span class="smcap lowercase">OWGILL</span>. I have seen a
document of the date of Charles I., which names one Agnes Wilson,
otherwise Randalson, widow of John, son of Randal Wilson; thus showing
that the patronymic was liable to vary in every generation, even in the
seventeenth century.</p>

<p>This is still the practice in the hill country of Lancashire, bordering
upon Yorkshire, where people are seldom known by a family name. The
individual is distinguished by the addition of the father's or mother's
Christian name, and sometimes by the further addition of those of
forefathers for a generation or two, as in the designation of Welshmen
in times past. The abode sometimes varies the style.</p>

<p>As an example, I may mention that a few years ago I sought an
heir-at-law in a town on the borders. I was referred to a man called
"Dick o' Jenny's;" he being the son of a second marriage, the mother's
name was used to distinguish him rather than his father's. Pursuing the
inquiry I found the first wife had been a "sister of ould Tommy at top
of th' huttock;" her daughter had married "John o' Bobby," and "John o'
Bobby's lad" was the man I wanted. When I had made him out, it was with
some difficulty that I ascertained (though amongst his kindred) that he
bore the family name of "Shepherd."</p>

<p class="right">  W. L.</p>


<p>I perceive that your correspondents C<span class="smcap lowercase">OWGILL</span> and J. H. (p. 290.),<a id="Page_425"></a> <span class="pagenum">[425]</span> and
 M<span class="smcap lowercase">R.</span> M<span class="smcap lowercase">ARK</span> A<span class="smcap lowercase">NTONY</span> L<span class="smcap lowercase">OWER</span> (p. 326.), make use of the word <i>surname</i> to
signify "the permanent appellative of particular families."</p>

<p>Now, I have always considered that the English language, in this as in
many other instances, possessed two words which, though alike in sound,
were very different both in origin and meaning:&mdash;<i>surname</i>, i.e.
<i>sur-nom</i>, the name added to the common appellation, for the purpose of
distinguishing an individual; as Rufus, C&oelig;ur de Lion, Lackland, in
the case of our early kings: and <i>sir-name</i>, or <i>sire-name</i>, being that
which in recent times, and in most countries, every one born in wedlock
has inherited from his sire, and which is the subject of the articles in
"N. &amp; Q."</p>

<p>As I do not suppose that your correspondents, the last of whom is of
considerable authority on this subject, have used the term unadvisedly,
I am anxious to know the grounds on which they would disallow my theory.</p>

     <p class="right"> E. H. Y.</p>


<p>I am glad to perceive that M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. L<span class="smcap lowercase">OWER</span> has on the stocks a systematic
Dictionary of Surnames. For the reason stated by him, it is neither
desirable nor possible that it should include <i>all</i> English surnames.
The majority derive their origin from places or districts of limited
dimensions, and to enumerate them would be an interminable and very
thankless task. M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. L. has therefore judiciously determined to exercise
his discretion on this class of cases. Nor are the names derived from
Christian names generally worth insertion, for every Christian name has,
in some form, been converted into a surname, either with or without
alteration. Those which originate in <i>extinct</i> or <i>provincial</i>
employments and trades will supply an instructive and interesting
collection, such as Tucker, Challoner, Tozer, Crowder, Berner, &amp;c.; and
will also afford scope for glossarial illustration.</p>

<p>I also trust that his etymological research will be successfully
exercised on such names as&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

      <p>Nettleship</p>
      <p>Moneypenny</p>
      <p>Peabody</p>
      <p>Sidebottom</p>
     <p> Sheepshanks</p>
      <p>Snodgrass</p>
      <p>Wiggins</p>
     <p> Figgins</p>
      <p>Higgins</p>
     <p> Wigglesworth</p>
     <p> Calcraft</p>
     <p> Lammercraft, and other crafts (crofts?)</p>
      <p>Pennefather</p>
      <p>Ocock</p>
      <p>Pocock</p>
     <p> Locock, and omne quod exit in cock, of which some forty or fifty are in use.</p>

</div>

<p>Let me also bring under his notice the singularly unattractive name of
<i>Suckbitch</i>. It is used by more than one branch of a respectable and
ancient family in the West of England, and I have traced its existence
for at least five centuries. Instead of availing themselves of the
recent opinions of some great lawyers, that a surname may be changed at
will, this family rather pride themselves on a name that can boast an
antiquity probably not surpassed by that of any family in England. The
shape of it has, however, deviated from the ancient form, so as to
become more significant, but certainly less graceful than it was; and
the change is probably an illustration of a familiar fact: viz. that we
are not generally the authors of our own surnames, but receive them from
our neighbours, and that, to a certain extent, they continue to have the
same character of instability which they originally possessed. The
earliest form of it known to me is <i>Sokespic</i>,&mdash;a word which seems to
indicate a Saxon origin. The <i>spic</i>, or bacon end of it has now
generally become <i>spitch</i> in the names of places; as in Spitchwick, a
well-known seat in Devonshire. Whether the <i>soke</i> or <i>suck</i> end of it be
from <i>sucan</i>, and the whole name equivalent to the modern <i>Chawbacon</i>,
is a matter which I leave for the investigation of M<span class="smcap lowercase">R</span>. L<span class="smcap lowercase">OWER</span>. At all
events, the old form will be a warning to the etymologist not to search
for the origin of the name in any legend like that which ascribes the
nutrition of the infant founders of Rome to a she-wolf.</p>

<p>I have met with many modern instances of the mutability of surnames
among labouring people, and even in a class above them. In 1841 a person
named <i>Duke</i> was on the list of voters for Penryn, in Cornwall. His
original name was <i>Rapson</i>; but the name being very common in his
neighbourhood, people long distinguished him by the name of <i>Duke</i>,
because he kept the "Duke of York's Arms:" and this last name has since
become the permanent recognised family name. This is a fact which I have
had satisfactory means of verifying.</p>

Waterloo was not a myth!" but I am glad to be able to state, from the
very best authority, the circumstance of the celebrated order to the
Guards on that day. It was at all times the Duke of Wellington's habit
to cover as much as possible troops exposed to the fire of cannon, by
taking advantage of any irregularity of ground, and making them<a id="Page_426"></a> <span class="pagenum">[426]</span>
sit or lie down, the better to cover them from fire till the moment of
attack; and the Duke's common practice was, just as the enemy came
close, and was on the point of attacking him, he attacked them. What he
may have said on this occasion, and <i>probably did say</i>, was, "<i>Stand up,
Guards</i>;" and then gave the commanding officers the order to attack. One
would not pledge oneself to the very syllables of such a command on such
an occasion; but what I have stated is the recollection of one who was

asking your correspondents whether the unctuous substance known as
"bear's grease" was in use at the period referred to; and if the reply
be in the affirmative, I would suggest the following interpretation of
the couplet.</p>

<p>King William and King Charles had shown so little wisdom and
discrimination in their knighting and pensioning of worthless poets,
that they must be supposed to have been anointed, at their coronation,
with bear's grease, instead of the holy ointment commonly used for such
purposes, and which is considered to possess the power of conferring on
the kingly office those very virtues in which William and Charles had

</h4>

<p>&mdash;Near Ravensworth Castle is a
stone column, concerning which there is a tradition that it was one of
the crosses erected to hold markets at during the great plague at
Newcastle in 1645, when the produce of the county was not allowed to be
exposed for sale at a less distance than three miles from that town.</p>

<p>There is another stone of this description on the boundary between Dent
and Widdal, in the West Riding of the county of York; it is near an old
road from Dent to Hawes, and is now called the "Cross upon Cross-hills."</p>

<p>&mdash;In reply to the Queries
of R. H. (see No. 125. p. 274.), 1. "Why the reprinted pages of the 1st
volume of the <i>Arch√¶ologia Cambrensis</i> do not agree with those in the
original copies?" and 2. Why "nearly a whole page of <i>interesting
matter</i><a id="Page_427"></a> <span class="pagenum">[427]</span> has been omitted?"&mdash;it may be sufficient to state that
the introduction of two additional notes at pages 204. and 209. rendered
the first impossible: and, secondly, that the omission complained of was
anything but of interest, as it only related to a supposed irregularity
in the delivery of the early numbers, which subsequent inquiry proved to
be groundless, and therefore it was suppressed.</p>

<p>Besides the notes above-mentioned, the letter-press has been revised and
various typographical errors corrected, so as to render the second
edition in many respects superior to the first.</p>

<span><i>Emaciated Monumental Effigies</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., pp. 247. 301. 353.).</span>
</h4>


<p>&mdash;B<span class="smcap lowercase">URIENSIS</span> has been furnished by several of your correspondents
with many examples of the representation of an emaciated corpse in
connexion with tombs, but no one has yet referred him to that very
remarkable instance at Tewkesbury. The tomb is usually assigned, I
believe, to Abbot Wakeman. If anything were needed to refute the absurd
notion of the forty days' fast, I think the figure on this tomb would
supply the clue to the true conception of the artist; and show that it
was intended, by such figures, to remind the passers-by of their own
mortality by representing the hollow cheek and sunken eyes, and
emaciated form, of a corpse from which life had only recently departed:
for, in the figure on this tomb, the idea of mortality is carried still
further, and the more humbling and revolting thought of corruption and
decay is suggested to the mind by the representation of noxious reptiles
and worms crawling over the lifeless form, and revelling in their
disgusting banquet.</p>

   <p class="right">M. Y. R. W.</p>


<p>I have read somewhere that these monuments with emaciated figures were
erected during the lifetime of the individual as an act of humiliation,
and to remind himself as well as others of mortality and the instability
of human grandeur. If this cannot be disproved by facts, it affords a
satisfactory solution. There is a small chapel connected with Bishop
Fleming's in Lincoln Minster, and with others, where masses were said
for the repose of their souls; so it is probable that these were at
least designed during their lives, which would manifest their humility.</p>

<p>&mdash;Navigators meet with the
Little Petrel, Storm<a id="Page_428"></a> <span class="pagenum">[428]</span> Finch, or Stormy Petrel, the <i>Procellaria
pellagica</i> of Linn√¶us, in every part of the ocean, diving, running on
foot, or skimming over the highest waves with the greatest ease. It
seems to foresee the coming storm long ere the seamen can discover any
signs of its approach; and they make this known by congregating together
under the wake of the vessel, as if to shelter themselves from it, and
they thus warn the mariner to guard against the coming danger. At night
they set up a piercing cry. This usefulness to the sailor is the obvious
cause of the latter having such an objection to their being killed. I am
unable to say who Mother Carey was; but I might venture a conjecture why
the bird who guards the seaman with such <i>care</i> bears its familiar name.</p>

<p>The name of "Mother Carey's Chickens" is said to have been originally
bestowed upon Stormy Petrels by Captain Carteret's sailors, probably
from some celebrated ideal hag of that name. As these birds are supposed
to be seen only before stormy weather, they are not welcome visitors.</p>

<h4>
<span><i>Burnomania</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. v., p. 127.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;Your correspondent E<span class="smcap lowercase">LGINENSIS</span> has got
the "Burnomania" of Dr. William Peebles, the minister of
Newton-upon-Ayr, himself one of the minor poets of Scotland by virtue of
his <i>Crisis, or the Progress of Revolutionary Principles</i>, Edinburgh,
1803 and 1804; and <i>Poems, consisting of Odes and Elegies</i>, Glasgow,
1810; all in my collection.</p>

<p>Like the transcendent powers of a living vocalist, the genius of Burns
could brook no rival, and for a long period, notwithstanding the futile
attempts of the smaller poetical <i>fry</i> to arrest its progress by their
Lilliputian shafts, the "Ayrshire Ploughman" maintained a species of
monopoly of the public mind and attention.</p>

<p>Dr. Peebles, as a candidate for poetical fame, no doubt found this
"Burnomania" sufficiently annoying; he therefore put forth his puny arm,
in the publication alluded to by E<span class="smcap lowercase">LGINENSIS</span>, to stem it, and,
considering that the poetry of Burns was then in the zenith of its
popularity, we need not add that the worthy Doctor's work proved but a
<i>turf</i> to the <i>cataract</i>, and is only now known as a curiosity.</p>

<p>I may however notice, that Dr. Peebles had a deeper <i>grudge</i> than
rivalry to settle with Burns, the satirical poet having aimed at him in
the "Holy Fair" and the "Kirk's Alarm;" and should your correspondent
seek to know more of the author of his book, he will find him noticed in
Paterson's <i>Contemporaries of Burns</i>, Edinburgh, 1830.</p>

<p>While upon the subject I may further note, that among many other carpers
at the "Burnomania" was James Maxwell, better known as the "Poet in
Paisley," who attacked Burns and his friend Lapraik in a <i>brochure</i>,
entitled "<i>Animadversions on some Poets and Poetasters of the present
Age, especially R&mdash;&mdash;t B&mdash;&mdash;s and J&mdash;&mdash;n L&mdash;&mdash;k, with a Contrast of some
of the former Age</i>: Paisley, Neilson, for the Author, 1788. In this
curious piece, which was unknown to Motherwell,&mdash;our pair of poets, with
all their patrons and friends,&mdash;among whom Maxwell is <i>shocked</i> to find
both <i>ministers</i> and <i>elders</i>,&mdash;</p>

<div class="poem">

   <p>   "For some of our clergy his poems esteem,</p>
      <p>And some of our elders think no man like him,"&mdash;</p>

</div>

<p class="noindent">all these, and such like, are severely censured by the moral poet for
admiring "this stupid blockhead," besides being menaced with a certain
place, to which their favourites are certainly doomed, should they
continue to support such arch-enemies of the Kirk and order. How
appropriate, then, is the remark of the Rev. Hamilton Paul, one of
Burns' warmest admirers and editors, when, <i>lumping</i> all these envious
spirits together, he says,&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "Some weak attempts have been made by narrow-minded men to expose
   to ridicule this 'Burnomania,' as they term it; but like
   self-love converted by the plastic power of the poet into social
   affection, it is spreading wider and wider every day."</p>

<span><i>Chantrey's Sleeping Children</i> </span>
<span>(Vol. ii., pp. 70. 94.).</span>
</h4>

<p>&mdash;There is, in
Ashbourne Church in Derbyshire, a beautiful figure of a sleeping child
by Thomas Banks, R.A., from which it is generally said that Chantrey
took the idea of his celebrated monument in Lichfield Cathedral. It is a
tradition in Ashbourne, that Chantrey drew the sketch for his sleeping
children at an inn in the place, immediately after having seen Banks'
sculpture in the parish church. The monument at Ashbourne is to
Penelope, daughter of Sir Brooke Boothby, born April 11th, 1785, died
Nov. 12th, 1791, and on it there are inscriptions in four languages,
English, French, Latin, and Italian. The following description of it,
taken<a id="Page_429"></a> <span class="pagenum">[429]</span> from <i>The History and Topography of Ashbourne</i>, may be
acceptable to some your readers, who may compare it with their
recollections of Chantrey's figures:&mdash;</p>

<p class="blockquot">   "It represents a child of delicate and amiable features, who has
   long suffered from slow and incurable disease, lightly, but
   rather carelessly, reclining on her right side. The position of
   the meek and lovely sufferer shows that she has just assumed it
   in order to seek temporary relief from pain, or from the
   weariness that a protracted repose, even on the softest
   materials, eventually causes. The little patient is extended, in
   the position just described, on a marble mattress and pillow, to
   which the hand of the sculptor has communicated the apparent
   texture of the softest down. The expression of the countenance is
   slightly indicative of pain, felt even in the intervals of
   slumber; and the little hands, lifted towards the countenance,
   plainly show that the sufferer has so placed them, in order that
   they and the arms may be in some measure a support to the body,
   and relieve it from the aching tenderness caused by long contact
   with the couch on which it rests. Around the head is bound, in
   loose folds, a handkerchief, which allows the artist greater
   scope to exhibit the child's features. The body-costume is a
   low-fronted frock with short sleeves, most gracefully sculptured.
   The whole of the drapery is in the most finished style, and the
   ease and softness of the folds are an admirable proof of the
   delicate chiselling of the artist. He has shown his natural and
   pure taste in the manner in which he has placed the feet. The
   entire position of the figure is faultless; and it represents,
   with refined fidelity to nature, the female infant form,
   patiently and slowly perishing beneath the steady undermining
   progress of irresistible decay."</p>

<span><i>Arkwright</i></span>
<span> (Vol. v., p. 320.).</span>

<p>&mdash;This surname would originally denote
the fabricator of such <i>arks</i>, or large chests made of strong oaken
planks, as are still to be found under that name in most old farmhouses,
at least in this neighbourhood, where they are chiefly used for storing
meal or flour. The fact of our translators of the Bible having called
the sacred chest in the Holy of Holies by this term seems to point to a
more general use of the word in their days than at present obtains. Mr.
Hunter (<i>Hallamsh. Gloss.</i>, p. 5.) says that the strong boxes in which
the Jews kept their valuables were anciently called their arks
(<i>archas</i>), and that the word is so found in the <i>F&oelig;dera</i>, 45 Hen.
III. It occurs twice in the Church Accounts of this parish.</p>

</h4>

<p>&mdash;Seeing a
notice in "N. &amp; Q." of Breydenbach's <i>Opus Transmarinum</i>, and a
suggestion of Dr. Kitto that this work was written by Felix Faber, I am
induced to call attention to another work written by the latter, which
is still extant in his <i>own MS.</i>, in the library at Ulm, bearing the
following title: <i>Fratris Felicis Fabri Evagatorium in Terr√¶ Sanct√¶,
Arabi√¶ et √Ügypti Peregrinationem</i>, and which was printed for the first
time for the Literarische Verein at Stuttgart, a society established
there about ten years since, with objects somewhat similar to our Camden
Society. This was one of its earliest publications, and as the number of
copies printed was very small, the volumes are now rarely to be met
with. The author informs his brethren of the monastery of Ulm, for whose
especial benefit he professes to have written his book, that he composed
it soon after his return from his second journey, the interval between
the first and <i>second</i> journey having been occupied in reading and
making notes from all the existing books on the same subject which he
could meet with (it is to be regretted that he has not given us a list
of these), "de quibus omnibus," he adds, "tuli quidquid deserviebat
proposito meo, ex qua collectura grande volumen comportavi." With this
collection of notes he appears to have set forth on his second
expedition, "<i>quia post h√¶c omnia in multis dubius remansi et incertus,
quia multa legeram et pauca videram</i>." Traversing Jerusalem, Arabia, and
√Ügypt, "<i>conferens ea, qu√¶ prius legeram et collegeram ad ipsa loca, et

<h3>
<span>NOTES ON BOOKS, ETC.</span>
</h3>


<p>The steady progress which sound Arch√¶ology is making in this country is
shown, and the benefits which will accrue from such progress to those
who are desirous of investigating the early history of this island and
its inhabitants is rendered evident, by the fact, that discoverers of
prim√¶val remains no longer endeavour to build upon those remains some
strange theories which have no foundation beyond the fancy of those who
pen them. On the contrary, Arch√¶ologists are now content to give us
plain and distinct particulars of the discoveries they make, and to
leave to future labourers the task of comparing the different objects,
and of evolving from such comparison those trustworthy illustrations of
our early history which are so highly to be prized. The truth of these
remarks will be seen by a glance at the interesting volume entitled
<i>Fairford Graves; a Record of Researches in an Anglo-Saxon Burial-place
in Gloucestershire</i>, in which Mr. Wylie narrates, with much clearness
and simplicity, the result of a very interesting series of excavations
made at Fairford, on the site of a Saxon necropolis, more particularly
of those made at the commencement of the past year. These discoveries
furnish some very valuable materials towards a more complete history of
the Anglo-Saxon civilisation than we yet possess; and Mr. Wylie deserves
the thanks of his brother antiquaries for his well-directed zeal on the
occasion, and for the judicious manner in which he has told his story.
The work is very profusely illustrated; and is one of the best
contributions which have recently been made to the history of our
prim√¶val antiquities.</p>

<p>We have received, and read with great pleasure, <i>Two Introductory
Lectures upon Arch√¶ology, delivered in the University of Cambridge</i>, by
the Rev. J. H. Marsden. We are not sure that these lectures are not
privately printed; and in that doubt should have passed them without
notice, had not their merits, as the production of a scholar and a man
of taste, seemed to us such as to make it desirable that they should be
placed within the reach of all whom they are calculated to interest.
They are the first-fruits of Mr. Disney's munificent donation to the
University of Cambridge.</p>

<p>We have received the second volume of Bohn's reprint of <i>The Literary
Works of Sir Joshua Reynolds</i>, edited by H. W. H. Beechey, which
completes the work. No President ever filled the Chair of the Royal
Academy with greater benefit to the students than did Sir Joshua; and
this cheap and useful edition of the invaluable legacy which he
bequeathed to them is well calculated not only for their use, but for
more general circulation, now that the arts of design are receiving such
deserved attention in this country.</p>

<p>The people of Manchester will shortly commence their great experiment of
a <i>Free Library</i>, which, it is hoped, will be opened in the course of
the present month, probably by Prince Albert. It contains about twenty
thousand volumes, consisting of about twelve thousand books of reference
and eight thousand to form the library of circulation, which will be
lent <i>freely</i> to all persons bringing recommendations or certificates of
good character. The books are all <i>well bound</i> and in excellent
condition, and the managers have no fears but that they will be returned
from circulation in the same state. We shall look with great interest to
the result; for it is clear that what is good for Manchester must be
good for London, and for all other places where men do congregate.</p>

been unable to obtain a Copy of the GREAT EXHIBITION CHART, printed in
Colours, and presented by the Proprietors of the WEEKLY DISPATCH, to
their Subscribers and the Public, in the months of January and February
last, A RE-ISSUE has been determined upon, to take place on SUNDAY the
16th of MAY. The Chart, which has undergone a careful revision, shows by
simple diagrams the number of persons that visited the Exhibition daily,
the amount of money taken at the various entrances, the quantity of
refreshments consumed; the names of the Royal Commissioners; an account
of the origin of the Palace, and its dimensions in feet. In order that
every individual in the country may possess this statistical reflex of
curious and interesting results, to mark the demolition of the building,
and to serve as a memento of its existence, the Chart will be delivered
GRATIS to every Subscriber and Purchaser of the DISPATCH on the day
stated.</p>

<p class="indh6"> *&#8270;* The DISPATCH is published at 4 o'clock every Saturday
morning, in time for the First Railway Trains leaving London, and for
the Morning Mails. Early orders should be given to any Newsvendor, in
